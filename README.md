TODO: as of time of writing (2020-03-12), the 'positions' have not been separated from roles.

* *Role*: encapsulates a set of duties. Policy deals with roles.
* *Position*: maps one or more roles to a position within the Company. The Company defines jobs and the Org Chart in terms of positions.

Example: Bob's position at Company X is as the 'Compliance and Security Officer'. This position maps to the Security Officer, Compliance Officer, and Privacy Officer roles. Company Policy defines Bob's duties and responsibilities in terms of these roles.
